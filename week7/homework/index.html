    <p>I plan to create a car dashboard interface by breaking it down into three main parts, as shown in the sketch below.</p>
    <p>The main car dashboard will be the first part, followed by the steering wheel as the second part, and the display screen as the third part.</p>
    <img src="./Sketch.PNG" width="500" height="800"/>
    <P>In order to create the steering wheel, I found an Youtube Video to follow</P>
    <p>1. For the steeliing wheel, I first created an torus</p>
    <img src="./Torus.png" width="460" height="320">
    <p>2. Then I added individual origins using three faces inside the torus</p>

    <p>3. Connect the individual origins</p>

    <p>4. Extrude region and move</p>

    <p>5. Add modifier subdivisioin surface and shade smooth</p>

    <p>6. Extrude the top round part</p> 
    <img src="./Extrude the top .png" width="500" height="300">
    <p>Inset face</p>
    <img src="./inset face.png" width="400" height="325">
    <P>Extrude the steeling wheel pad part</P>
    <img src="./Pad.png" width="500" height="500">
    <p>Apply material and texture</p>
    <img src="./Materail.png" width="1000" height="500">
    <P>add dashboard and car windshield, round screen; because my interface will be circular</P>
    <img src="./pain car dashboard.png" width="850" height="600">
    <p>This is what my interface will look like</p>
    <img src="interface.png" width="600" height="200">
    <P>Apply material</P>

    <p>After finished the basic rough model, I added a chair model for scale reference, and found out the size of the dashboard is way too small.</p>
    <p>Using the chair as reference for size, I made the dashboard bigger to be able to fit in two chairs. </p>
    <p>I also rescale the circular interface, the steeling wheel to make them looks more realistic</p>
    <img src="Rescale.png" width="800" height="600">
    <p>I also remove the windshield because it is not helping me present my interface</p>
    <p>Then I apply round corner to the dashboard to make it look smoother</p>
    <p>Getting rid of the three buttons because they are too far away for the driver to reach</p>
    <p>And adding the center console between two chairs</p>
    <p>Apply the car interface image to the circular screen</p>
    <p>Apply materials to all the parts</p>
    <img src="Process.png" width="1000" height="750">
    <p>To create the environment and make it feel more like you are driving on the street</p>
    <p>I first created the "wall" around the main model</p>
    <p>Adjust the lighting and adding more lighting to the model</p>
    <p>Then I pick an image as someone driving on the street</p>
    <p>apply the image to the font of the car dashboard</p>
    <p>adjust the camera angle to the point where someone is sitting on the chair</p>
    <p>Below is the final outcome</p>
