        Intent:
      <p>
        Both the cat and the mouses are in the same room. The cat can move and eat the
        mice, the mice can only move. If you click on Canvas, you can add another mouse. If the cat eat all the mouse, the cat will stop moving
      </p>
      <p>Process:</p>
      <p>
        First, Set up the canvas size. 
        Then created two classes, one class is for the cat and the other one is for the mouse. both has their own display with cat and mouse shape.
        In the cat class, we gave it a random X & Y value to determine it location on the canvas. also speed and step size value to control it movement.
        Move method for the cat to run randomly base on speed and step size.
        In the mouse class, we gave it a random X & Y value. Speed and step size value to control it movement. Also, mouse has a boolean value caught to determine if the mouse caught or not.
        Move method for the cat to run randomly base on speed and step size if the mouse is still alive.
      </p>
      <p>Finally:</p>
      <p>
        We created one cat and 12 mouses in the sketch.
        Both cat and mouses will move base on their .move() method.
        The cat will catch and eat the mouse within the distance of 15. the mouse will disappear from the room
        When there is no mouse in the room, the cat will stop moving
        New mouse babies will born by clicking on the canvas.
